> To see the world as it is and to love it


Hi, I am *@wayblink* (Anyang, Wang), a big data engineer. I am currently working in Bytedance(Beijing). 

I studied Electonic and Commication Engineering and graduated from Shanghai Jiao Tong University by 2018. Before that I got my bachelor degree from Xi'an Jiao Tong University.

I am a film/running/basketball lover and I'm obsessed with skiing and jazz music these days.
